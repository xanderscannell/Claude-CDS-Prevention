# Context Loading by Phase

<!-- This file tells Claude (and you) which context files are most relevant
     for each phase of the project. Saves time by avoiding loading everything. -->

## Phase 3: Validation & Polish (CURRENT)

**Always read**:
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- `CONVENTIONS.md`

**Read if relevant**:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — when modifying plugin structure
- `DECISIONS.md` — when considering architectural changes
- `MASTER_PLAN.md` — to track progress on validation goals

**Can skip**:
- `SETUP.md` (only needed for new contributors)

---

## Phase 4: Community & Iteration (FUTURE)

**Always read**:
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- `CONVENTIONS.md`

**Read if relevant**:
- `DECISIONS.md` — when evaluating feature requests
- `MASTER_PLAN.md` — to prioritize improvements
- `CHECKPOINTS/` — to review past session learnings

---

## Maintenance Mode

**Always read**:
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md`

**Read if relevant**:
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — when making changes
- `DECISIONS.md` — before proposing changes to settled questions
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — when adding new components

---

<!-- The goal is efficient context loading - Claude doesn't need to read
     every file every time. Point it to what matters for the current work. -->
